During testing, additional issues and improvements were discovered. However, due to time and personnel constraints, they could not be fixed before release, and will be amended in future updates. 

Improvement One:
- Can't apply multiple typography styles onto the same words or sentences. For instance, if the highlighted text is "hello, world!", it cannot be both underlined and bolded at once. 
-- Proposal: 
Developers could update the program so that each word (Or even each character) has its own tag_sequence, with the font module. 
Currently, font = "Arial 18", but it can be amended so that font = "Arial 18 bold italic underline". 
When the user highlights some text, the program can loop each word or character, and get its current font style from a dictionary. After the user changes a specific attribute, the new typography style can be saved into the dictionary for future reference. 

Improvement Two:
- For running the executable file, users must download both the file and the icons folder, and ensure that they are within the same folder. This is not very user-friendly.
-- Proposal: Developers could compile the application into an .MSI file for ease of access.
