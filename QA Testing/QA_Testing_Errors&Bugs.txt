Bug #1
- pressing the play button while text is being played crashes the program
  proposed resolution: while text is being played, turns play button into a pause button. also add a stop button

Bug #2
- Can't apply multiple typography styles onto the same words or sentences. For instance, if the highlighted text is "hello, world!", it cannot be both underlined and bolded at once.
